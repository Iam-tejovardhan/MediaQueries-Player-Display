    <p>VIKINGS</p>
    <p>A year ago at this time, Skoldiers couldn’t help but fixate on the latest and greatest hotshot coordinator to be the next head coach of the Minnesota Vikings. Shoot, even a few folks (yours truly included) were intrigued at the idea/rumor of a maverick offensive-minded college coach by the name of Lane Kiffin coming to town. But, as we near the finish line of the 2022 season, the Vikings and New York Giants are jockeying for position within the NFC playoff picture with first-year NFL head coaches.
